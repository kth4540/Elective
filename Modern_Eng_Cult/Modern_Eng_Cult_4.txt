What is culture?

	it's relatively easy to think of how behavior and customs differ from one country to another

	
	1.culture is a way of life. culture is the context within which we exist, think, feel, and relate to others,
	it is the "glue" that binds a group of people together 
	- governs our behavior in groups

	2. culture as a blueprint that guides the behavior of people in a community
	-is incubated in family life
	-makes us sensitives to matters of status
	-helps iis know what others expect of us and what will happen of we do not live up to their expectations

	3. culture's variability and diversity
